## About
This repository includes various small projects implemented in C and C++. The focus is on demonstrating core concepts and basic programming skills essential for an embedded software engineering role.

## Projects
Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure.
- **Heap**: Demonstrates heap operations.
- **Merge**: Example of the merge algorithm.
- **Single Linked List**: Implementation of a single linked list.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Basic operations on a BST.
- **Calculator**: A simple calculator program written in C.
- **Threading Example**: A multithreading example in C.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**:
  - C
  - C++

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- A C/C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Make (optional, for building projects using Makefiles)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Bekathunder215/C-and-Cpp.git
    cd C-and-Cpp
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to run.
2. Compile the program using a C/C++ compiler. For example:
    ```sh
    gcc project_name.c -o project_name
    ```
   or for C++ files:
    ```sh
    g++ project_name.cpp -o project_name
    ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
    ```sh
    ./project_name
    ```
